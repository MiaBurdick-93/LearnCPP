This repository is to show my progress throughout my journey learning C++. 


Week 1 - Printing_to_Console_Practice.cpp: Focus on application of fundamental data types, escape sequences, and cout function to display text on the console.

Week 2 - ledgeon.cpp: Focus on application of mathematical operators, variable declaration and definition and within that uniform initialization

Week 3 - Prolet.cpp: Focus on application of invoking/calling a function and understanding necessary inputs and expected outputs
